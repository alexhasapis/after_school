While in pursuit of knowledge about other world regions, including their histories, economies and world languages, students acquire the knowledge and skills needed to prepare for college and/or careers. Teachers and other adults who make up the learning community forge supportive relationships with students and parents while providing challenging and engaging learning experiences. Our school partners with various community, arts and business organizations to help students achieve success. Our theme of international studies extends beyond the classroom, where students participate in ongoing ‘Advisory Day Out’ excursions where the multiculturalism of NYC becomes the classroom.</overview_paragraph><program_highlights>Global/International Studies in core subjects, Literacy block schedule, Personalized instruction in small classes, Student Advisories, International travel opportunities, After-school program focused on youth leadership</program_highlights><language_classes>Chinese (Mandarin), Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>Psychology</advancedplacement_courses><online_ap_courses>Chinese Language and Culture, Spanish Literature and Culture</online_ap_courses><online_language_courses>Chinese (Mandarin), Spanish</online_language_courses><extracurricular_activities>Math through Card Play; Art, Poetry/Spoken Word, Drama, Book, STEP, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Student Government/Leadership, Future Project</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Basketball</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Softball</psal_sports_girls><psal_sports_coed>Soccer</psal_sports_coed><school_sports>Boxing, Track, CHAMPS, Tennis, Flag Football, Softball</school_sports><partner_cbo>The Henry Street Settlement; Asia Society; America Reads; Future Project; 21st Century Grant</partner_cbo><partner_hospital>Gouverneur Hospital (Turning Points)</partner_hospital><partner_highered>New York University</partner_highered><partner_cultural>Asia Society</partner_cultural><partner_nonprofit>Heart of America Foundation</partner_nonprofit><partner_other>United Nations</partner_other><start_time>8:30 AM</start_time><end_time>3:30 PM</end_time><se_services>This school will provide students with disabilities the supports and services indicated on their IEPs.</se_services><ell_programs>ESL</ell_programs><school_accessibility_description>Functionally Accessible</school_accessibility_description><number_programs>1</number_programs><priority01>Priority to continuing 8th graders</priority01><priority02>Then to Manhattan students or residents who attend an information session</priority02><priority03>Then to New York City residents who attend an information session</priority03><priority04>Then to Manhattan students or residents</priority04><priority05>Then to New York City residents</priority05><location_1 human_address="{&quot;address&quot;:&quot;220 Henry Street&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;New York&quot;,&quot;state&quot;:&quot;NY&quot;,&quot;zip&quot;:&quot;10002&quot;}" latitude="40.71376394700047" longitude="-73.98526003999967" needs_recoding="false"/></row><row _id="2" _uuid="BDD14420-4CC7-4269-81C2-A398AD0FA1C6" _position="2" _address="http://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/n3p6-zve2/2"><dbn>01M448</dbn><school_name>University Neighborhood High School</school_name><boro>Manhattan</boro><building_code>M446</building_code><phone_number>212-962-4341</phone_number><fax_number>212-267-5611</fax_number><grade_span_min>9</grade_span_min><grade_span_max>12</grade_span_max><bus>M14A, M14D, M15, M21, M22, M9</bus><subway>F to East Broadway ; J, M, Z to Delancey St-Essex St</subway><primary_address_line_1>200 Monroe Street</primary_address_line_1><city>New York</city><state_code>NY</state_code><zip>10002</zip><website>www.universityneighborhoodhs.com</website><total_students>299</total_students><campus_name>N/A</campus_name><overview_paragraph>University Neighborhood High School (UNHS) is the first collaborative partnership school between New York University and the New York City Department of Education.

Our goal is to teach social, technological and analytic skills in order to facilitate the development of the next generation of leaders. Our collaborative approach to education fosters a supportive community which raises the performance level of each individual. In our labs and classrooms, students learn by doing. Skilled and committed faculty teach with rigor and passion for their subjects. Housed in a dedicated building on The City College of New York campus, HSMSE gives students an early taste of college life as they eat in the college cafeteria and study in the college library. Newly-built science and engineering labs offer up-to-date equipment, and all classrooms have internet access and computers or laptop carts. Students are drawn from all five boroughs of NYC and hail from diverse ethnic backgrounds.

Our mission is to capture the energy and interests of young people by providing apprenticeships. Students are required to participate in the apprenticeship program and give quarterly public presentations of their learning. Each student’s curriculum is determined by his or her unique interests, background and learning style. Each teacher is responsible for only 15 children. Learning Through Apprenticeship (LTA) is the center of the Bronx Guild curriculum. At the worksites, students take on real-world tasks and projects under the supervision of a mentor. Back at school, the students work with their crew leaders building and reinforcing the skills and knowledge needed to complete those projects. Our very successful program has placed students in over 300 apprenticeships since opening our doors in 2002.</overview_paragraph><program_highlights>Project-based Learning, Interdisciplinary courses, Extended Time Periods in class</program_highlights><language_classes>Spanish</language_classes><extracurricular_activities>Student Government, School-based garden, EPIC Theater Ensemble</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball, Football, Outdoor Track, Soccer</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball, Bowling, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Softball, Tennis, Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><partner_cbo>The Big Picture Company</partner_cbo><partner_hospital>The Jewish Home &amp; Hospital Lifecare System, New York Presbyterian Hospital, Montefiore Medical Center, Morris Heights Health Center</partner_hospital><partner_highered>Columbia University, Lehman College, New York University (NYU)</partner_highered><partner_cultural>ATO Records, Barbizon Acting Center, Bronx River Arts Center, Chashama, Children's Art Carnival, Caribbean Cultural Center, Def Jam, Fashion Design, Harlem Textiles, Hospital Audiences, Inc.

We have received awards for our work in this rebuilding. Our students not only get their core academic courses, but can also commit to one of six career academies. With millions of dollars in scholarships earned by our seniors each year, internships for students starting freshman year and students moving on to prestigious universities like Fordham, NYU, St. John’s and Penn State, the question shouldn't be, 'Why should I attend Truman?' but rather, 'Why would I go anywhere else?'

Our school engages all students in acquiring and developing the skills necessary for success by infusing English as a Second Language (ESL) into all content areas of instruction. Technology is also integrated throughout the curriculum to develop and reinforce concepts and skills. Our classes are small and our academic program is challenging, with the expectation that students have a successful, timely transition out of the ESL program and graduate in four years. Students share their native cultures and languages and learn to become active citizens in their new country as they adapt to and flourish in American culture and in their use of the English language. Our staff works closely with students to ensure progress throughout the high school years and as they continue their education and/or join the world of work.</overview_paragraph><program_highlights>Advisory, Student Support Services, Career Interest and Self Assessment, College visits, SAT and Regents Preparation, Trips, Cultural Events, Internet After-school, Arts and Music Enrichment, Journalism; Opportunities to take college courses while in high school, Online courses, Academic competitions in Mathematics and Social Studies; Trips to cultural, historic and recreational sites in and out of New York City</program_highlights><language_classes>French, Spanish, Spanish Native Language Arts</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>Calculus AB, French Language and Culture, Spanish Language and Culture</advancedplacement_courses><online_ap_courses>French Language and Culture, Spanish Language and Culture</online_ap_courses><online_language_courses>French, Spanish</online_language_courses><extracurricular_activities>Art, Choral, Drama, Community Service, Computer/Technology, Dance, Electronic Publishing, Instrumental and Jazz Bands, Mock Trial, Music, Student Government, Tutoring, Yearbook, Government, Newsletter, Performances, Trips, Professional Field Connections, On-Line Exploration</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball, Lacrosse, Outdoor Track, Soccer</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball, Outdoor Track, Softball, Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><school_sports>Basketball, Lacrosse, Rugby, Soccer, Table Tennis, Volleyball, Weight Training, Yoga</school_sports><partner_cbo>Bold Eagle Association, PENCIL, Bronx Institute (Lehman College), Communities in Schools, New York Cares, Morris Heights Health Center New York Blood Center, Youth Philanthropic Initiative(YPI), Lehman College, Fordham University</partner_cbo><partner_hospital>Morris Heights Health Center</partner_hospital><partner_highered>Fordham University, Hunter College, Lehman College, Hostos Community College, Teachers College/Columbia University, University of Vermont</partner_highered><addtl_info1>Dress Code Required: baby blue shirt/blouse, gray dress pants/skirt, navy blue sweater, black shoes, Extra classes are required based on academic needs, Focus on learning English</addtl_info1><start_time>8:00 AM</start_time><end_time>3:00 PM</end_time><se_services>This school will provide students with disabilities the supports and services indicated on their IEPs.</se_services><ell_programs>ESL</ell_programs><school_accessibility_description>Functionally Accessible</school_accessibility_description><number_programs>1</number_programs><priority01>Open only to New York City residents who have lived in the United States three years or fewer and are English Language Learners as per New York City Department of Education guidelines, who score beginner or intermediate on the NYSESLAT or LAB-R.</priority01><location_1 human_address="{&quot;address&quot;:&quot;921 East 228Th Street&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;Bronx&quot;,&quot;state&quot;:&quot;NY&quot;,&quot;zip&quot;:&quot;10466&quot;}" latitude="40.887919214000476" longitude="-73.85287161399964" needs_recoding="false"/></row><row _id="205" _uuid="AB6A1382-F56D-4039-BD78-1152373F98FE" _position="205" _address="http://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/n3p6-zve2/205"><dbn>11X514</dbn><school_name>The Bronxwood Preparatory Academy</school_name><boro>Bronx</boro><building_code>X362</building_code><phone_number>718-696-3820</phone_number><fax_number>718-696-3821</fax_number><grade_span_min>9</grade_span_min><grade_span_max>12</grade_span_max><bus>Bx31, Bx39, Bx8</bus><subway>2, 5 to 225th St</subway><primary_address_line_1>921 East 228Th Street</primary_address_line_1><city>Bronx</city><state_code>NY</state_code><zip>10466</zip><website>http://schools.nyc.gov/schoolportals/11/X514</website><total_students>414</total_students><campus_name>N/A</campus_name><overview_paragraph>We look to awaken in our students a passion for learning that continues throughout their lives.

Every student at Campos takes daily talent classes of their choice; students become musicians, singers, dancers, actors, and visual artists. Partnerships with major community arts organizations and the College Bound Initiative (CBI) ensure that students also connect their learning to the real world. For example, students conduct gallery openings at professional galleries throughout the city and begin visiting colleges as freshmen. In addition, an in-house CBI counselor ensures that students are prepared for college acceptance and enrollment upon graduation.

Students earn credits and prepare for the New York State Regents exams through traditional coursework, small group tutoring, after-school programs, and online learning.</overview_paragraph><program_highlights>Digital literacy, Big Picture Network of schools, internships, mentors, small Advisory, project-based learning, online learning, credit make-up and recovery</program_highlights><language_classes>Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>English Language and Composition, United States History</advancedplacement_courses><online_ap_courses>English Language and Composition, United States History</online_ap_courses><extracurricular_activities>Drama and theater, EPIC (Shakespeare); Student Government; Sisterhood Club; Video Club</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball, Bowling, Football &amp; JV Football, Handball, Soccer, Volleyball, Wrestling</psal_sports_boys><school_sports>Intramural Basketball Tournaments</school_sports><partner_cbo>Big Picture Learning</partner_cbo><partner_cultural>EPIC Theatre Ensemble (Shakespeare), New Literacy, American Museum of Natural History, Prospect Park Zoo</partner_cultural><partner_nonprofit>National Center on Institutions and Alternatives (NCIA), Law Coalition of Concerned Legal Professionals, NYPD, Green in Brooklyn, Works in Progress, YMCA, Pier Glass, Citi Storage</partner_nonprofit><partner_corporate>Law Offices of Damien Brown</partner_corporate><partner_other>Bio Bus, Rocking the Boat, Harlem DNA Lab, Rooftop Farms, Palo Samko Woodworking, Anthony Sisto Carpentry, Anomaly, Whistlebox, People's Firehouse, Homage Skate Shop, Marc Jacobs, Sean Casey Animal Rescue, Freedom Star</partner_other><addtl_info1>Internships available for Juniors and Seniors, PM Academy for Credit Recovery/Make-Up</addtl_info1><addtl_info2>Community Service Requirement, Our school requires an Academic Portfolio for graduation, Weekend Program offered</addtl_info2><start_time>8:00 AM</start_time><end_time>3:00 PM</end_time><se_services>This school will provide students with disabilities the supports and services indicated on their IEPs.</se_services><ell_programs>ESL</ell_programs><school_accessibility_description>Functionally Accessible</school_accessibility_description><number_programs>1</number_programs><priority01>Priority to New York City residents who attend an information session</priority01><priority02>Then to New York City residents</priority02><location_1 human_address="{&quot;address&quot;:&quot;50 Bedford Avenue&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;Brooklyn&quot;,&quot;state&quot;:&quot;NY&quot;,&quot;zip&quot;:&quot;11222&quot;}" latitude="40.72264264000046" longitude="-73.95258304499964" needs_recoding="false"/></row><row _id="252" _uuid="9DB54794-AF24-4FB8-8114-3169B4F3316C" _position="252" _address="http://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/n3p6-zve2/252"><dbn>14K685</dbn><school_name>El Puente Academy for Peace and Justice</school_name><boro>Brooklyn</boro><building_code>K778</building_code><phone_number>718-387-1125</phone_number><fax_number>718-387-4229</fax_number><grade_span_min>9</grade_span_min><grade_span_max>12</grade_span_max><bus>B24, B39, B44, B44-SBS, B46, B48, B57, B60, B62, Q54, Q59</bus><subway>G to Broadway ; J, M to Hewes St ; Z to Marcy Ave</subway><primary_address_line_1>250 Hooper Street</primary_address_line_1><city>Brooklyn</city><state_code>NY</state_code><zip>11211</zip><website>www.elpuente.us</website><total_students>225</total_students><campus_name>N/A</campus_name><school_type>Consortium School</school_type><overview_paragraph>We are a small, innovative learning community that promotes comprehensive academic excellence for all students while inspiring and nurturing leadership for peace and justice.

Lincoln alumni have gone on to great success in every imaginable field. This great tradition and the legacy of our namesake still resonate at Lincoln today. Abraham Lincoln High School is a community where all members help one another pursue their potential. Through our partnership with Johns Hopkins University's Talent Development High Schools, we offer Small Learning Communities (SLC). Our ninth and tenth grade Academies feature a block schedule in which teams of teachers meet with guidance counselors to discuss and support each student's academic performance and socio-emotional development. The first two years at Lincoln are dedicated to meeting high school graduation requirements, while the junior and senior years in the upper academies are devoted to college and career readiness in the sciences or humanities. Lincoln provides students with the individualized attention of SLC, as well as the assets, resources, and facilities of a large comprehensive high school. We offer a state-of-the-art photography studio, two animal science labs, a vast library, multiple computer labs, spacious grounds, three gymnasiums and a swimming pool. Our extensive elective course offerings, including Advanced Placement and College Now classes, empower our academic achievers to complete up to a year of college credit during their secondary studies. Lincoln is a school where students have every opportunity to pursue their potential.</overview_paragraph><program_highlights>The Institute for Professions in Science (IPS), The Gilder Lehrman Honors Institute for American Studies, Professional Photography, Pre-Veterinary Animal Science</program_highlights><language_classes>Spanish, Spanish Native Language Arts</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>Calculus AB, English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, Environmental Science, Human Geography, Psychology, United States Government and Politics, World History</advancedplacement_courses><extracurricular_activities>Acting Studio, Animal Care Squad, Anime, Arista National Honor Society, Cheerleading, Chess, Chinese, Conflict Negotiation and Mediation, Debate Team, ELL Acting Studio, Gay-Straight Alliance, Guitar, Hiking, History, Key Club, Landmark Yearbook, Library Squad, Lincoln Ambassadors, 'Lincoln Log' Newspaper, Marine Lab Squad, South Asian, Student Organization, Weightlifting</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball &amp; JV Baseball, Basketball &amp; JV Basketball, Bowling, Cricket, Cross Country, Football &amp; JV Football, Handball, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Swimming, Tennis, Volleyball, Wrestling</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball &amp; JV Basketball, Bowling, Cricket, Cross Country, Handball, Indoor Track, Lacrosse, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Softball &amp; JV Softball, Swimming, Tennis, Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><partner_cbo>Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, Jewish Community Center of Greater Coney Island, Horizons Academy, RAPP (Relationship Abuse Prevention Program), HealthCorps, Project Hope, CATCH Program, Good Shepherd Services,</partner_cbo><partner_hospital>Coney Island Hospital Center</partner_hospital><partner_highered>Brooklyn College, Kingsborough Community College</partner_highered><partner_cultural>The City University of New York (CUNY) Arts</partner_cultural><partner_nonprofit>Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History</partner_nonprofit><partner_other>Johns Hopkins University's Talent Development High Schools, Young Adult Borough Center</partner_other><addtl_info1>For Professional Photography (K24L), you may schedule an appointment for a tour of the program.</addtl_info1><addtl_info2>Community Service Requirement, Student Summer Orientation</addtl_info2><start_time>7:28 AM</start_time><end_time>3:10 PM</end_time><se_services>This school will provide students with disabilities the supports and services indicated on their IEPs.</se_services><ell_programs>ESL</ell_programs><school_accessibility_description>Functionally Accessible</school_accessibility_description><number_programs>6</number_programs><priority01>Open to Brooklyn students or residents</priority01><priority02>For Zoned Program only: priority to students who live in the zoned area</priority02><location_1 human_address="{&quot;address&quot;:&quot;2800 Ocean Parkway&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;Brooklyn&quot;,&quot;state&quot;:&quot;NY&quot;,&quot;zip&quot;:&quot;11235&quot;}" latitude="40.58230836300049" longitude="-73.96746574699966" needs_recoding="false"/></row><row _id="323" _uuid="FB487DBC-8A73-483D-8FCD-6335269CE8E9" _position="323" _address="http://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/n3p6-zve2/323"><dbn>21K468</dbn><school_name>Kingsborough Early College School</school_name><boro>Brooklyn</boro><building_code>K400</building_code><phone_number>718-333-7850</phone_number><fax_number>718-333-7875</fax_number><grade_span_min>6</grade_span_min><grade_span_max>12</grade_span_max><bus>B1, B3, B4, B6, B64, B82</bus><subway>D to 25th Ave ; N to Ave U ; N to Gravesend - 86th St</subway><primary_address_line_1>2630 Benson Avenue</primary_address_line_1><city>Brooklyn</city><state_code>NY</state_code><zip>11214</zip><website>www.KECSS.info</website><total_students>551</total_students><campus_name>Lafayette Educational Campus</campus_name><overview_paragraph>At Kingsborough Early College School (KECS), all students have the opportunity to earn a tuition-free Associate Degree from Kingsborough Community College (KCC) during their time in secondary school.

Classes focus learning on reading, writing, and communicating fluently in English while also providing opportunities to maintain students' native languages. We use real-world learning by giving our students experiences in local healthcare settings before they graduate. Students gain practical skills including CPR and first aid, explore careers through 11th grade internships at local medical centers, and take early college coursework with our university partners. These hands-on opportunities both provide a context for language acquisition and allow students to use their native language as an asset in their service to the community.</overview_paragraph><program_highlights>Extended class periods, Small class sizes, Project-based instruction, Emphasis on collaborative coursework, Medical career focus, Team setting, Advisory courses, Internships, Early College programs</program_highlights><extracurricular_activities>DNA Research Team, Astronomy, Anime</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball &amp; JV Baseball, Basketball &amp; JV Basketball, Bowling, Cross Country, Golf, Handball, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Tennis, Volleyball, Wrestling</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball, Cross Country, Gymnastics, Indoor Track, Outdoor Track, Soccer, Softball &amp; JV Softball, Tennis, Volleyball &amp; JV Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><partner_hospital>Elmhurst Hospital</partner_hospital><partner_highered>College Now, Queens College and Kingsborough Community College</partner_highered><partner_cultural>Theater Development Fund (TDF) Materials for the Arts (MFTA)</partner_cultural><partner_nonprofit>Internationals Network for Public Schools (INPS) and National Academy Foundation (NAF)</partner_nonprofit><addtl_info1>Gym uniform Required: Please contact the school for more  information., 60-Minute/Extended Periods</addtl_info1><start_time>8:30 AM</start_time><end_time>3:30 PM</end_time><se_services>This school will provide students with disabilities the supports and services indicated on their IEPs.</se_services><ell_programs>ESL</ell_programs><school_accessibility_description>Not Functionally Accessible</school_accessibility_description><number_programs>1</number_programs><priority01>Priority to Queens residents who have lived in the United States four years or fewer at the time of admission to high school and whose home language is not English and are English Language Learners as per New York City Department of Education guidelines</priority01><priority02>Then to New York City residents who have lived in the United States four years or fewer at the time of admission to high school and whose home language is not English and are English Language Learners as per New York City Department of Education guidelines</priority02><location_1 human_address="{&quot;address&quot;:&quot;48-01 90 Street&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;Elmhurst&quot;,&quot;state&quot;:&quot;NY&quot;,&quot;zip&quot;:&quot;11373&quot;}" latitude="40.74120520000048" longitude="-73.87472988399963" needs_recoding="false"/></row><row _id="340" _uuid="EF746D61-E757-4D69-9A0C-91A52AA26823" _position="340" _address="http://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/n3p6-zve2/340"><dbn>24Q264</dbn><school_name>Academy of Finance and Enterprise</school_name><boro>Queens</boro><building_code>Q735</building_code><phone_number>718-389-3623</phone_number><fax_number>718-389-3724</fax_number><grade_span_min>9</grade_span_min><grade_span_max>12</grade_span_max><bus>B62, Q100, Q101, Q102, Q32, Q39, Q60, Q66, Q67</bus><subway>7 to Rawson St-33rd St ; E, M, R to Queens Plaza ; G to Court Square ; N, Q to Queensboro Plaza</subway><primary_address_line_1>30-20 Thomson Avenue</primary_address_line_1><city>Long Island City</city><state_code>NY</state_code><zip>11101</zip><website>www.AOFEHS.org</website><total_students>467</total_students><campus_name>N/A</campus_name><overview_paragraph>The mission of the Academy of Finance and Enterprise is to provide students with a challenging, student-centered, project-based, academic, business/financial and technology program.

In a supportive environment upheld by our four pillars of Honor, Excellence, Curiosity and Celebration, students engage in a rigorous academic program of Regents, Advanced Placement (AP) and College Now courses. While at our school, students can become highly proficient in Chinese, Korean or Japanese. In addition to a college-bound academic program, we offer a robust after-school club culture supported by an active student government. We promote a positive school atmosphere by encouraging acts of kindness through Rachel’s Challenge, a nationwide anti-bullying program. Parent-teacher communication is important to us. We cultivate parent partnerships through monthly PTA meetings on evenings or weekends. Grades and transcripts, along with progress reports, are readily available to parents online through PupilPath. All seniors must attend daily college preparatory courses, and can take onsite Kaplan SAT prep courses to gain a competitive edge in the college application process. Our team works hard to ensure that 100% of our graduates continue on to higher education.</overview_paragraph><program_highlights>College Bound Initiative with a dedicated full-time college counselor; College Now courses are offered for free college credits after school on our campus and at nearby Queens College and LaGuardia Community College; Pre-Calculus; TEALS Computer Science classes; Regents in: Chemistry, Physics; Queens College Literacy Lab; Opportunities for semester and summer abroad programs; ASD Nest Program for students; Mighty Milers; Classes in dance and drama</program_highlights><language_classes>Chinese (Mandarin), Japanese, Korean</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>Calculus AB, Computer Science A, English Language and Composition, English Literature and Composition, Environmental Science, Human Geography, Psychology</advancedplacement_courses><extracurricular_activities>Advisory, All School Yearbook, Anime, Art, Can You 24?, Chinese Erhu, College Trips, Community Service Opportunities, Cultural Studies in China, Dance Show, Dance Team, Drama, Friends of Rachel, Gay/Straight Alliance, Hispanic Club, Judo, Junior NAACP Club, Key Club, Korean Painting, Korean POP Dance, Leadership Trip to Korea, Literacy Lab, Martial Arts, Model UN, Multicultural Night, National Honor Society, NYPD Explorers Program, OST Homework Help, Peer Mediation, Photography, Pre-Med, Robotics, Student Government, Summer in Japan, School Musical, School Newspaper, Talent Show, Team Soccer, Team Basketball, other clubs by student request</extracurricular_activities><school_sports>Judo, Martial Arts, Morning Sports Program, Team Basketball, Team Soccer</school_sports><partner_cbo>New Visions for Public Schools; College Bound Initiative; NAACP; NYPD Youth Explorers Program; Queens College; LaGuardia CC; Hanban Asia Society; Japan Society; Korea Society; Key Club; Model UN; Museum of Natural History.</partner_cbo><partner_hospital>Holiday Toys for Tots- New York Hospital</partner_hospital><partner_highered>The City University of New York (CUNY)</partner_highered><partner_cultural>Japan Society; Korea Society; HanBan Asia Society; American Museum of Natural History</partner_cultural><partner_nonprofit>New Visions for Public Schools</partner_nonprofit><partner_corporate>White Coffee Corp.</partner_corporate><partner_other>Sister schools in Hangzhou, China and in Nagoya, Japan.

The urban planning, theme-based curriculum takes students out of the classroom and into their communities to develop skills that will move them toward higher education and careers, while at the same time tapping into their innate curiosity towards the world around them.</overview_paragraph><program_highlights>As an iZone school, we implement innovative ideas in instruction; We use technology to meet the needs of individual students; Through our New Tech Network partnership, we are a 1:1 school with computers available for every student in class</program_highlights><language_classes>Spanish</language_classes><advancedplacement_courses>Calculus AB, English Language and Composition, Microeconomics, Spanish Language and Culture, Studio Art: Drawing</advancedplacement_courses><extracurricular_activities>Advanced Art, African Dance, African Drumming, Annual “Day of Dialogue” Student-led Conference, Cheerleading, Community Service, Fine Arts, Hispanic Cultural Club, National Honor Society, Peer Mediation, Peer Tutoring, Student Government, Student Leadership Countil, Student Newspaper, Video Game Club</extracurricular_activities><psal_sports_boys>Baseball, Basketball &amp; JV Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball</psal_sports_boys><psal_sports_girls>Basketball, Softball, Volleyball</psal_sports_girls><school_sports>Baseball, Basketball, Flag Football, Volleyball, Weightlifting</school_sports><partner_cbo>Make the Road NY, Healing Arts Initiative, EcoStation: NY</partner_cbo><partner_highered>Brooklyn College, New York University, College Now at Medgar Evers College, Posse Foundation, Yale Model United Nations</partner_highered><partner_cultural>Tribeca Film Institute, NY State Council on the Arts</partner_cultural><partner_nonprofit>Center for Urban Pedagogy, Clearpool Education Center, LEAP for Girls, Parternship with Children, Generation Citizen, Global Potential</partner_nonprofit><partner_corporate>Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Pencil</partner_corporate><partner_financial>Deutsche Bank</partner_financial><partner_other>NYC Teaching Collaborative, Summer Search, Nature Conservancy, Opportunities for a Better Tomorrow</partner_other><addtl_info1>Dress Code Required: short or long-sleeved shirt/blouse, jeans/slacks/pants/skirt (no shorter than 4 inches above the knee), sneakers/shoes, All freshmen are encouraged to attend a 6 week Summer Bridge Program to earn 2 credits, All freshmen are programmed for periods 1 through 9, Internship opportunities are available for all students</addtl_info1><start_time>8:15 AM</start_time><end_time>3:45 PM</end_time><se_services>This school will provide students with disabilities the supports and services indicated on their IEPs.</se_services><ell_programs>ESL</ell_programs><school_accessibility_description>Functionally Accessible</school_accessibility_description><number_programs>1</number_programs><priority01>Priority to Brooklyn students or residents who attend an information session</priority01><priority02>Then to New York City residents who attend an information session</priority02><priority03>Then to Brooklyn students or residents</priority03><priority04>Then to New York City residents</priority04><location_1 human_address="{&quot;address&quot;:&quot;400 Irving Avenue&quot;,&quot;city&quot;:&quot;Brooklyn&quot;,&quot;state&quot;:&quot;NY&quot;,&quot;zip&quot;:&quot;11237&quot;}" latitude="40.696961848000456" longitude="-73.91081593899963" needs_recoding="false"/></row><row _id="434" _uuid="8EDC78CD-E3B3-4AB8-B005-C7C076D5A90D" _position="434" _address="http://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/n3p6-zve2/434"><dbn>32K554</dbn><school_name>All City Leadership Secondary School</school_name><boro>Brooklyn</boro><building_code>K554</building_code><phone_number>718-246-6500</phone_number><fax_number>718-246-6509</fax_number><grade_span_min>6</grade_span_min><grade_span_max>12</grade_span_max><bus>B13, B26, B38, B52, B54, B60, Q55, Q58</bus><subway>L, M to Myrtle Ave-Wyckoff Ave</subway><primary_address_line_1>321 Palmetto Street</primary_address_line_1><city>Brooklyn</city><state_code>NY</state_code><zip>11237</zip><website>http://schools.nyc.gov/schoolportals/32/K554</website><total_students>333</total_students><campus_name>N/A</campus_name><overview_paragraph>We educate students from grades six to twelve.
